# PrivStack: Privacy-Focused DeFi Suite

PrivStack is a privacy-focused DeFi protocol built on the Stacks blockchain that enables users to perform private financial transactions using zero-knowledge proofs. The protocol leverages Bitcoin's security through Stacks' consensus mechanism while maintaining user privacy.

## Features

- Private deposits and withdrawals using zero-knowledge proofs
- Commitment-based privacy scheme
- Nullifier prevention of double-spending
- Admin controls for protocol safety
- Integration with Stacks blockchain and settlement on Bitcoin

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

1. **Privacy Pool**: Core contract managing private transactions
2. **Commitment System**: Handles deposit commitments
3. **Nullifier Registry**: Prevents double-spending
4. **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Validates transaction proofs

### Key Functions

- `deposit`: Create a private deposit with a commitment
- `withdraw`: Withdraw funds using zero-knowledge proof
- `get-total-liquidity`: View total pool liquidity
- `get-user-balance`: Check user balances
- `pause-pool` / `resume-pool`: Admin safety controls

## Installation

1. Install Clarinet:
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/download/v1.0.0/clarinet-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv clarinet /usr/local/bin
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/privstack.git
cd privstack
```

3. Initialize the project:
```bash
clarinet new
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

1. Configure your Stacks wallet
2. Deploy using Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

### Interacting with the Contract

Example deposit:
```clarity
(contract-call? .privstack deposit u1000 0x...)
```

Example withdrawal:
```clarity
(contract-call? .privstack withdraw u500 0x... 0x...)
```

## Security Considerations

- Zero-knowledge proofs must be properly verified
- Commitment schemes should use strong cryptographic primitives
- Nullifier system prevents double-spending
- Admin functions should be properly secured
- Regular security audits recommended
